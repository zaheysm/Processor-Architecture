<h2>Question</h2>
<p>The 16 bit value $8002 represents what unsigned integer?
     ...represents what two's complement signed integer? ...represents what
one's complement signed integer?</p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>$8002 is 32,770 (unsigned). As a signed value, it is negative (most
   significant bit is 1). To get the two's complement value, we
   complement all bits to get $7FFD and add one to get $7FFE. This is
   32,766, but since it is negative, the value is -32766. To get the
   one's complement value, we complement all bits and don't add one.
   This is 32,765, so the value is -32,765.</p>
