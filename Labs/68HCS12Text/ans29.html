<h2>Question</h2>

<p>The text shows how the SPI can be interfaced to multiple
   devices, with an effective shift register length a multiple of 8
   bits. However could the SPI be interfaced to a single 4 bit device?
   If so, explain how, and if not, explain why not.</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<p>Yes it can. If shifting least significant bit first (LSBFE=1), then
   the first four bits shifted out will be shifted through the device
   and back into the microcontroller. The last four bits shifted out
   will be captured by the device. The first four bits shifted into
   the microcontroller will be from the device. So the transmitted
   data from the microcontroller needs to be in the upper four bits
   and the received data from the device will appear in the lower four
   bits. If LSBFE=0, the reasoning is the same, but the data from the
   microcontroller will be in the lower four bits and the data to the
   microcontroller will be in the upper four bits.</p>
