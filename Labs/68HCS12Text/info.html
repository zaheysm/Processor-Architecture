<h1>Designing with Microcontrollers -- The 68HCS12</h1>
<p>Revision 4.0</p>
<h2>License Agreement</h2>

<p>The 68HCS12 simulator and<em> Designing with Microcontrollers</em>
text are copyrighted items for which reasonably limited rights are
given to the purchaser. The purchaser agrees to treat them like a
book. In other words, only one person may be able to access these
items at any one time.  To achieve this, either the items may be
installed on a single computer (in which case it may be accessible by
more than one person, but only one at a time), or on multiple
computers if the purchaser has sole access to the multiple copies.
These items may not be placed on a server computer.</p>


<p>The purchaser may make a single printed copy of part or all of the
text for his/her personal use.</p>

<p>The purchaser may sell the CD to another person as long as the purchaser
destroys all copies of the items on the CD, including any printed
copy. The new purchaser must agree to the terms
of this license agreement.</p>

<p>The simulator is licensed for educational, non-commercial use only.</p>

<p>The Assembler is a freeware program, and can be redistributed and used
without restrictions. The AsmIDE program is licensed for free use under
the Mozilla Public License, v1.1. Consult that program for further details.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, if multiple persons are to be using these items, such
as in a class setting, each person must purchase a copy. The CD is priced
fairly, much less expensive than either a commercial simulator or a text
book, so please treat the author fairly!</p>

<h2>Warranty</h2>

<p>No warranty is expressed or implied for the contents of the CD. If the
CD is defective, it will be replaced free of charge within 30 days of shipment.
There may be, and probably are, errors in the text and the simulator, however,
just as in a printed book, the author has no obligation to make corrections.</p>

<p>In any case, by using the contents of this CD, the purchaser agrees that
the total of any of the author's liability resulting from the use of the
contents of the CD is limited to the purchase price of the CD.</p>

<p>Any errata will be listed at <a
