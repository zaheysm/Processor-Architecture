<p>This program counts the number of RTI interrupts in word location
$1000, the number of IRQ interrupts in word location $1002, and the
number of XIRQ interrupts in word location $1004. A reset will cause
all counts to be zeroed. The RTI interrupt rate is every 1.024ms. Use
the interrupt check boxes to assert IRQ, XIRQ, and RESET while the
program is running. Step the program to see what happens when an IRQ
occurs during execution of the XIRQ service routine and when an XIRQ
occurs during execution of an IRQ service routine.</p>
<p>The Simulator will appear in a separate window. When this page is
exited, the simulator will stop. The controls in the simulator for
loading code, generating a log file, and taking a snapshot are disabled when run from the
browser.</p>
