<h2><a name="Bitwise Boolean Operations"></a>Bitwise Boolean Operations</h2>

<p>Instructions exist in the 68HC12 for bitwise AND, OR, and EOR:</p>

<div class="boxed"><ul>
  <li><em><a name="anda">anda</a></em> - AND accumulator A with memory</li>
  <li><em><a name="andb">andb</a></em> - AND accumulator B with memory</li>
  <li><em><a name="bita">bita</a></em> - Bit Test accumulator A with memory</li>
  <li><em><a name="bitb">bitb</a></em> - Bit Test accumulator B with memory</li>
  <li><em><a name="eora">eora</a> </em>- EOR accumulator A with memory</li>
  <li><em><a name="eorb">eorb</a></em> - EOR accumulator B with memory</li>
  <li><em><a name="oraa">oraa</a> - </em>OR accumulator A with memory</li>
  <li><em><a name="orab">orab</a> - </em>OR accumulator B with memory</li>
</ul></div>

<p>These instructions allow immediate, direct, extended, and all indexed addressing
modes. When immediate mode is used, the immediate operand is typically
referred to as a <em>mask</em>. They all alter the N and Z condition code bits based on the result of the operation, clear the V bit, and leave the
other bits unchanged.</p>

<p>The <em>Bit Test</em> operation is an AND where the result is not stored. It is used to only set the condition codes based on the result of the operation, and
has the same relationship to the AND instructions as the compare instructions have to the subtract instructions. The AND instructions can be used
to clear selected accumulator bits, the ORA instructions can be used to set selected accumulator bits, and the EOR instructions can be used to
complement (toggle) selected bits. The <a href="part010d.html"><em>Bitwise Boolean Summary</em></a> details these uses.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>    bita    #4            ; branch if bit 2 (numbered from right)
    bne     foo           ; in accumulator A is non-zero
    anda    #~4           ; clear bit 2 in accumulator A
    eora    #$80          ; complement the MSB of accumulator A
    orab    loc1          ; OR accumulator B with contents of loc1,
                          ;  which sets the bits in B which are set
                          ;  in memory byte at location loc1.  </pre>

<p>The AND and occasionally OR operations are also used for <em>bit fields</em>. A bit field is a sequence of adjacent bits in a byte that we want to treat as a
(typically integer) value. For instance, using bit fields, we could store two 3 bit values, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, and a two bit value, <em>C</em>,  in a single byte. We could
store the bits left to right: AAABBBCC, in other words, the three most significant bits are value A, the next three bits, bits 2 through 4, are value
B, and the two least significant bits are value C. If the byte were in accumulator A, we could extract just the value C with an AND operation:</p>
<pre>    anda    #3</pre>

<p>We could extract the value B by shifting then using an AND operation:</p>
<pre>    lsra
    lsra
    anda    #7</pre>

<p>And we could extract the value C by shifting alone:</p>
<pre>    lsra
    lsra
    lsra
    lsra
    lsra</pre>

<p>If the values are stored in bytes VA, VB, and VC, we can combine them with the code:</p>
<pre>    ldaa    VA     ; Accumulator A has value ?????AAA
    lsla
    lsla
    lsla           ; Accumulator has value ??AAA000
    ldab    VB
    andb    #7     ; Accumulator B has value 00000BBB
    aba            ; Accumulator A has value ??AAABBB
                   ; (we could have used OR if it were available)
    lsla
    lsla           ; Accumulator A has value AAABBB??
    ldab    VC
    andb    #3     ; Accumulator B has value 000000CC
    aba            ; Accumulator A has value AAABBBCC</pre>

<p>See the  <a href="part010d.html"><em>Bitwise Boolean Summary</em></a> for an algorithm to insert and extract bit fields from bytes.    </p>

<p>Three instructions for the bitwise NOT operation:</p>

<div class="boxed"><ul>
  <li><em><a name="com">com</a></em> - Complement memory byte</li>
  <li><em><a name="coma">coma</a></em> - Complement accumulator A</li>
  <li><em><a name="comb">comb</a></em> - Complement accumulator B</li>
</ul></div>

<p>These instructions alter the N and Z condition code bits based on the result of the operation. They clear the V bit and set the C bit. The <em>com</em>
instruction allows extended or indexed addressing modes.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<pre>; This instruction sequence will clear the bits in byte location U1
; according the mask in M1 (a 1 bit means clear, a 0 bit means
; unchanged)
    ldaa    M1           ; Get mask
    coma                 ; ~M1
    anda    U1           ; U1&amp;~M1 - clear bits in U1
    staa    U1</pre>

<p>These instructions are used to set and clear bits in the condition code register:</p>

<div class="boxed"><ul>
  <li><em><a name="andcc">andcc</a></em> - AND CCR with mask</li>
  <li><em><a name="orcc">orcc</a></em> - OR CCR with mask</li>
  <li><em><a name="clc">clc</a></em> - Clear carry bit in CCR</li>
  <li><em><a name="cli">cli</a></em> - Clear interrupt bit in CCR</li>
  <li><em><a name="clv">clv</a></em> - Clear overflow bit in CCR</li>
  <li><em><a name="sec">sec</a></em> - Set carry bit in CCR</li>
  <li><em><a name="sei">sei</a></em> - Set interrupt bit in CCR</li>
  <li><em><a name="sev">sev</a></em> - Set overflow bit in CCR</li>
</ul></div>

<p>The first two instructions have a single operand which acts as a mask (and requires the # prefix character). They are used to clear and set the bits in
the condition code register, with the exception that the X bit cannot be set and clearing the I bit has a one clock cycle delay. The remaining
instructions are aliases for <em>andcc</em> or <em>orcc</em> which clear or set individual bits. </p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>    sec             ; Set carry bit then...
    adca    W7      ; Add contents of W7, plus 1, to accumulator A
    andcc   #~8     ; Clears the N bit in the CCR
    orcc    #5      ; Sets the Z and C bits in the CCR</pre>
