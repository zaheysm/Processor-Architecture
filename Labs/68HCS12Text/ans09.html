<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Accumulator A contains a value in the range 10 through 100. Can
  the value be considered signed? Can it be considered unsigned?</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Since the range of signed values is -128 through 127 and 10 through
   100 is within that range, it can be considered signed. Since the
   range of unsigned values is 0 through 255 and 10 through 100 is
   within that range, it can also be considered unsigned.</p>
