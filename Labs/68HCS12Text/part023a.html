<p>The Inter-Integrated Circuit bus was developed by Philips in the 1980s as a low cost interconnection bus. Commonly known as I<sup>2</sup>C (which is a trademark), the IIC bus is one of the most popular buses
for interfacing to microcontrollers.</p>
<h2><A name="Basics of Operation"></a>Basics of Operation</h2>
<p>The IIC bus is a multi-master bus which uses two signal lines (clock and
data) connected to all the devices on the bus, using a wired-or connection
on both lines among all the devices. A clever contention detection scheme
prevents any lost time if two or more masters request the bus simultaneously.
The original specification called for a 100,000 bits/second transfer rate
with up to 127 devices, however later modifications extended both the transfer
rate and the maximum number of devices. We will only be concerned with
the original base-line specification here.</p>
<p><img src="fig23a-1.gif" width="505" height="161" border="0"/></p>
<p>When the bus is idle, any master device can obtain control of the bus by
sending a start signal (denoted by <em>S</em> in the figure below). The master then sends 8 clock pulses with seven
address bits and a read/not write bit indicated if the master will be sending
data (write) or receiving data (read) from the slave. The master sends
an additional clock pulse during which time the addressed slave indicates
it is active and ready by pulling the SDA data line low. If the slave doesn't
exist or is not ready, no acknowledgement is given (indicated by <em>N</em> in the figure below) and the master then transmits a stop signal (indicated
by <em>P</em> in the figure) which relinquishes the bus.</p>
<p><img src="fig23a-2.gif" width="485" height="81" border="0"/></p>
<p>If a slave acknowledges the address (indicated by <em>A</em> in the figure below), the master can continue its operation. If it requested
a write operation, the master then sends any number of eight-bit bytes,
with a ninth bit after each byte coming from the slave to acknowledge the
receipt of the data. When the master has completed sending data bytes,
it then sends the stop signal which ends the transmission and relinquishes
the bus.</p>
<p><img src="fig23a-3.gif" width="480" height="95" border="0"/></p>
<p>If the master requested a read operation, the slave sends eight-bit byte data values to the master, each byte followed by an acknowledgement bit sent from the master. The master ends the transmission by not acknowledging the final byte. This tells the slave to stop sending data. Then the master sends the stop signal which ends the transmission and relinquishes the bus.</p>
<p><img src="fig23a-4.gif" width="480" height="111" border="0"/></p>
<p>It is also possible for the master to send and receive data in a single
transmission sequence. Typically the data sent is command or address information
for the slave, instructing the slave on what data to return. In this case,
the slave is addressed and the write data sent to the slave, then instead
of sending the stop signal, the master sends a <em>restart</em> signal, indicated by <em>R</em> in the figure. The master addresses the slave again, this time for a read
operation, and reads data from the slave as in the preceding example. The
restart signal behaves as a back-to-back stop and start, however the bus
is not released so no other master can intervene with another request.</p>
<p><img src="fig23a-5.gif" width="626" height="74" border="0"/></p>
<h2><A name="Electrical Description">Electrical Description</a></h2>
<p>The SCL (clock) and SDA (data) buses are normally in the high voltage state, held high by the pull-up resistors. Devices on the bus drive it to the low voltage state using &quot;wired-or&quot;, as described in the section <A href="part016.html">External Interrupts</a>. Normally the data bus is allowed to change state only when the clock
bus is low. The data bus changing state while the clock bus is high signals
one of <em>start</em>, <em>stop</em>, or <em>restart</em>, as shown in the figures below.</p>

<p>A master starts a transaction by acquiring the bus with the <em>start </em>signal. It indicates a start by pulling SDA low then pulling SCL low. This
brings all slave devices to attention to look for their address being sent
on the bus. The calling address and data transfers all have the same format
-- eight bits of data are sent and a single bit is returned. The nine active-high
clock cycles are always driven by the master, although the slave can extend
the low period of the clock by driving SCL low. When the master releases
the clock (letting it go high) it monitors the bus and does not proceed
until the bus actually goes to the high state.</p>
<p><img src="fig23a-9.gif" width="778" height="176" border="0"/></p>
<p>With the sending of the initial calling address, the addressed slave responds
by driving SDA low during the ninth clock. If the slave cannot handle the
request (it might be busy) or there is no device that is configured to
respond to the address, then no device will drive SDA low. The master interprets
this as a <em>nack</em> (negative acknowledgement). The master then relinquishes the bus by sending
the stop signal.</p>
<p><img src="fig23a-10.gif" width="714" height="172" border="0"/></p>
<p>In any case, after sending all data, the master sends the stop signal.
It does this by driving SDA low, releasing SCL, and then releasing SDA.
The rising edge of SDA while SCL is high is the stop signal. At this point
neither of the bus wires is being driven and the bus is released.</p>
<p><img src="fig23a-7.gif" width="265" height="173" border="0"/></p>
<p>If the master requests a read operation, data transfers are from the slave
to the master. The master continues to drive the clock. If the slave needs
more time to obtain and drive SDA with a data bit, it can extend the clock
low period by driving SCL low until it has the correct data bit level on
SDA. As mentioned before, the master monitors SCL and will not proceed
as long as it is in the low state.</p>
<p><img src="fig23a-11.gif" width="786" height="178" border="0"/></p>
<p>In the last byte received, the master does not assert ACK. This tells the
slave to not send any more data. This allows the master to send the stop
signal.</p>
<p><img src="fig23a-12.gif" width="714" height="172" border="0"/></p>
<p>In the case when the master first writes data and then reads data, the
restart signal is used to separate the read from the write. The master
releases SCL, drives SDA low, and then drives SCL low. Thus it reissues
a start signal without an intervening stop, which would relinquish the
bus.</p>
<p><img src="fig23a-8.gif" width="211" height="173" border="0"/></p>
<p>Bus contention, when two masters request the bus at the same time, is handled
in a simple but effective manner. Both masters think they are performing
the transaction; however they monitor the SDA line. If the SDA line is
low when a master wants to send a high, that means another master is performing
a transaction. The master driving the line low continues while the master
not driving the line low aborts its operation and tries again once a stop
signal is seen. This technique has no overhead -- the winning master is
not slowed down by the contention, and full bus throughput is maintained.</p>
<h2><A name="Implementation in the 68HCS12">Implementation in the 68HCS12</a></h2>
<p>The HCS12 Inter-Integrated Circuit module has three control registers, <em>IBAD</em>, <em>IBFD</em>, and <em>IBCR</em>, and a single status register, <em>IBSR</em>. In addition there is a data I/O register,<em> IBDR</em>. The bits of the control and status register are shown in the table below:</p>

<p>The IBAD register sets the address the module will respond as a slave.
It is important that the module not be used to address itself. Since in
almost all applications the 68HCS12 will only be the master, operation
as a slave will not be covered in this text. IBAD should be set to a non-zero
value that is not the same as any other device on the bus.</p>
<p>The IBFD register sets the frequency divider, the time SDA is held after
SCL is driven low, the time between SDA and SCL going low in a start signal,
and the time between SCL and SDA going high in a stop signal. These times
are best derived from a table in the <A href="../motorola/S12IICV2.pdf"><em>HCS12 Inter-Integrated Circuit Block Guide</em></a>. The system clock is used for the IIC circuit. This means that to run
the bus at 100 kHz with a 24 MHz system clock requires a divider of 240.
This value cannot be obtained, so a divider of 256 must be used.</p>
<p>If the internal pull-up resistor is used for the bus pull-ups, operation
at 100 kHz cannot be assured because the resistor value is too high. In
this case, the IIC data rate must be set slower.</p>
<p>In the IBCR register, <em>IBEN </em>enables the IIC Bus module. <em>IBIE</em> is the interrupt enable bit. <em>MS/*SL</em> is master/slave select; when this bit is set, a start signal is sent and when cleared a stop signal is sent. <em>TX/*RX</em> specifies the direction of of data transfers with a <em>1</em> meaning the master is transmitting and a <em>0</em> meaning the master is receiving. If the <em>TXAK</em> bit is set, then the module will acknowledge a data transfer when it is
a receiver. Writing a <em>1</em> to <em>RSTA</em> will send a restart signal. This bit is self-resetting and will always
read as a <em>0</em>. Finally, the <em>IBSWAI</em> bit being <em>1&nbsp;</em>will halt the bus clock when executing a <em>WAI</em> instruction. In general, this is not a good idea.</p>
<p>The status register, IBSR, contains the following bits. <em>TCF</em> indicates data is transferring when it has a value of <em>0</em>. <em>IBB </em>being <em>1</em> indicates the bus is busy (start is detected) while <em>0</em> indicates the bus is idle (stop is detected)<em>. IBAL </em>indicates arbitration is lost. This bit is reset by writing a <em>1</em> to it. If there are no other masters on the bus, this bit can be ignored.
<em>IBIF</em> is the interrupt flag. It is set when  arbitration is lost (IBAL set),
a byte transfer completes (TCF set) or the module is addressed as a slave
(IASS set). This bit is cleared by writing a <em>1</em> to it. <em>IAAS </em>and <em>SRW </em>are used for slave operation. The <em>RXAK</em> bit is set if no acknowledge was received in the preceding data transmission.</p>
<p>Writing to the IBDR data register when in transmit mode will start the
data transfer from the module. Reading the IBDR register when in receive
mode will start the data transfer to the module. This means that the IBDR
register is read once to start the receive operation, and then successive
reads will yield data from the slave and initiate the next read. To perform
the final read, the TXAK bit is set before the IBDR register is read for
the next to last value. This forces the module not to acknowledge the final
value. Then the TX/*RX bit is set before the final read of IBDR, but after
the final data byte as been received (as indicated by TCF being set).</p>
<p>A subroutine library which will help in using the IIC module has been provided as file <em><A href="iic.asm">iic.asm</a></em>. This library does not use interrupts, assumes the module cannot be addressed
as a slave, and assumes a single master, itself. The first subroutine is
used to initialize the IIC module. The 20 kHz option can be used with the
internal pull-up resistors.</p>
<pre>IICINIT:        ; Initialize IIC
        movb    #$23 IBFD       ; Set to 100KHz operation
;       movb    #$35 IBFD       ; Set to 20KHz operation
        movb    #$2 IBAD        ; Slave address 1 (never address our self, please!)
        bset    IBCR #$80       ; set IBEN
        rts</pre>
<p>The IICSTART subroutine is used to acquire the bus and address the slave.
The control byte, consisting of the 7 bit slave address and the R/*W bit
are passed to the subroutine in accumulator A. The routine that calls IICSTART
must check the IBB bit being set and IBAL being clear to know the slave
was addressed and arbitration was not lost. In systems with only one master,
the IBAL bit can be ignored.</p>
<p>In this and later subroutines, the use of <em>*</em> as the branch target performs a branch to self. It is convenient shorthand
that saves a label. The label <em>IICRESPONSE</em> is a branch target common for several of these subroutines that need to
wait for IBIF to set (indicating end of transmission) before returning.
It also checks for a NAK from the slave, and sends the stop signal (by
branching to IICSTOP) if that occurs.</p>
<pre>IICSTART:  ; Issue start and address the slave. Control byte in A
                ; Calling routine checks IBCR $20 clear for failure
        brset   IBSR #$20 *     ; wait for IBB flag to clear
        bset    IBCR #$30       ; Set XMIT and MASTER mode, emit START
        staa    IBDR            ; Calling address
        brclr   IBSR #$20 *     ; Wait for IBB flag to set
IICRESPONSE:
        brclr   IBSR #$2 *      ; Wait for IBIF to set
        bclr    IBSR #~$2       ; Clear IBIF
        brset   IBSR #$1 IICSTOP        ; Stop if NAK
        rts
</pre>
<p>For write operation, transmitting data to the slave involves storing the
data in IBDR and then branching to IICRESPONSE.</p>
<pre>IICTRANSMIT:       ; Data byte to send in A
                ; Calling routine checks IBCR $20 clear for failure
        staa    IBDR
        bra     IICRESPONSE
</pre>
<p>IICSTOP is used to end transmit mode and free the bus.</p>
<pre>IICSTOP:   ; Release bus and stop (only if transmitting)
        bclr    IBCR #$20
        rts
</pre>
<p>When reading from the slave, IICSWRCV is called after IICSTART to switch
the module to receive mode and start receiving the first byte of data.
If only one byte of data is to be read, IICRECEIVEONE is called instead
of IICSWRCV.</p>
<pre>IICSWRCV:       ; Switch to receive
        bclr    IBCR #$10       ; put in receive mode
        ldaa    IBDR         ; dummy read to start receive
        rts
</pre>
<p>In cases where data is first transmitted to the slave and then received,
a restart signal is necessary. IICRESTART is called to issue the restart
and send the new control byte which is in accumulator A. This control byte
should differ from the preceding control byte only in R/*W being 1 instead
of 0.</p>
<pre>IICRESTART:     ; Issue restart and address the slave. Control byte in A
                ; Calling routine checks IBCR $20 clear for failure
        bset    IBCR #$04       ; Generate restart
        staa    IBDR
        bra     IICRESPONSE</pre>
<p>There are three subroutines used to receive data from the slave when there
are two or more bytes which are to be read. IICRECEIVE is called for all
but the final two bytes, IICRECEIVEM1 is called for the next to last byte,
and IICRECEIVELAST is called for the final byte. Three subroutines are
necessary to properly handle disabling the ACK on the last byte and changing
the mode back to transmit at the end.</p>
<pre>IICRECEIVE:        ; Call for all but last two bytes of a read sequence 3 or more bytes long
                ; Data byte returned in A
        brclr   IBSR #$2 *      ; Wait for IBIF
        bclr    IBSR #~2        ; clear IBIF
        ldaa    IBDR            ; read byte (and start next receive)
        rts
</pre>
<pre>IICRECEIVEM1:      ; Call to receive next to last byte of multibyte receive sequence
                ; Data byte returned in A
        brclr   IBSR #$2 *      ; Wait for IBIF
        bclr    IBSR #~2        ; clear IBIF
        bset    IBCR #$8        ; Disable ACK for last receive
        ldaa    IBDR            ; read byte (and start last receive)
        rts
</pre>
<pre>IICRECEIVELAST: ; Call to receive last byte of multibyte receive sequence
                ; Data byte returned in A, Bus released
        brclr   IBSR #$2 *    ; Wait for IBIF
        bclr    IBSR #~2        ; clear IBIF
        bclr    IBCR #$08       ; REENABLE ACK
        bclr    IBCR #$20       ; Generate STOP
        bset    IBCR #$10       ; Set transmit
        ldaa    IBDR            ; read byte
        rts</pre>
<p>If only a single byte is being received, IICRECEIVEONE is called after
the IICSTART (or IICRESTART). </p>
<pre>IICRECEIVEONE:  ; Call to receive a single byte
                ; Data byte returned in A, Bus released
        bset    IBCR #$08       ; Disable ACK
        bclr    IBCR #$10       ; Put in receive mode
        ldaa    IBDR            ; dummy read, start last receive
        bra     IICRECEIVELAST</pre>
<p>The<em><A href="iic.asm"> iic.asm</a></em> file shows examples of
