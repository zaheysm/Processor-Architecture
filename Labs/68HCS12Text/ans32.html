<h2>Question</h2>

<p>The ADC in 8 bit integer mode produces a measured value (code)
   of $0000 for an input voltage of 0 volts and a measured value of
   $00FF for an input value of five volts. What is the scale factor in
   volts? What is the scale factor in millivolts?</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<p>The scale factor in units of volts is the value you need to
multiply the measured value by to get the voltage in units of volts.
This means the scale factor would be 5/255 volts. This can be seen
because if the measured value is 255 ($00ff), then 255*5/255 volts = 5
volts. Note how we carry the units through the calculation (the
measured values are "unitless", they just represent counts.)</p>

<p>The scale factor in units of millivolts is the value you need to
   multiply the measured value by to get the voltage in units of
   millivolts. This would be 5000/255 millivolts, 1000 times larger
   than the scale factor in volts.</p>
