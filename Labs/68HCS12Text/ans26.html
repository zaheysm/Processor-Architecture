<h2>Question</h2>

<p>When connecting external ROM memory, which control signals are
used?</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<p>Of the listed control signals, only ECLK is used. R/*W is not
   needed for a ROM, since it is only read. *LSTRB and ADDR0 are not
   needed for control since it does no harm to read a word even when
   only a byte is requested. The high-order address lines are used for
   address decoding and could be considered control signals, but are
   not considered so by the question instructions.</p>
