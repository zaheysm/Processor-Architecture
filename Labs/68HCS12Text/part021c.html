<p>In order to reduce the number of pins necessary on the microcontroller, many microcontrollers multiplex the address and data busses. In this arrangement, the address is
presented on the bus and must be externally latched because the bus must then be used for data. The MC9S12DP256 microcontroller is primarily intended for use in single
chip mode because it has a large amount of on-chip RAM and ROM. If it is desired to use this part in Expanded Narrow or Wide mode, the shared address and data bus
design is employed.</p>

<p>The following illustration shows the data and address connections to the microcontroller. In addition, port K provides 6 bits of extended addressing, described in the memory
expansion section, and two chip selects, ECS and XCS. Port E provides *LSTRB, R/*W, and ECLK signals.</p>

<p>we see that there are 16 address lines, giving a 64k byte address space. But the lines are also used for data. In Expanded Wide Mode, all 16 lines are used, while in Expanded
Narrow Mode only the most significant 8 are used. Looking in the Technical Specifications, we see:</p>

<p><img src="fig21c-2.gif" width="446" height="534" align=bottom /></p>

<p>The address must be latched on the leading edge of ECLK. A new control signal *XCS (External Chip Select) can be used in read operations to enable the memory device to
drive the data bus - we can't simply connect *OE to *CE. (*XCS has the same timing as the *ECS signal in the diagram above.) However some designs simply enable the
output when ECLK &amp; R/*W is true.</p>

<p>A transparent latch is used to hold the address. The latch is transparent (Input connects to output) when the enable input is asserted, and the output is held when the enable
input is low.  Using the Expanded Narrow Mode, our memory can be connected as shown in this partial schematic:</p>

<p>Timing considerations are very difficult with this part and design, so typically a low clock speed or clock stretch is used. The HCS12 also uses a memory expansion scheme
which also must be taken into account in order to use the external interface. In a typical application, the internal Flash ROM would still be used and all external memory
would appear in the $8000-$BFFF address range, the exact 16K memory "page" selected using port K.  See <a href="part021e.html">Memory Expansion</a> for details.</p>
