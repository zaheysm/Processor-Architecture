<p>Most of the time it is not possible to debug a program in the target system. Sometimes the hardware is not available. Other times there is no room for the
debugger program or no serial port is available. This page will cover several solutions to the problem. The first, simulation, is a software solution. A
program run on a personal computer or workstation simulates the operation of the processor, memory, and often peripheral hardware as well. The second
solution is an evaluation board. The evaluation board contains a microcontroller, a debugger program, and typically additional memory and a serial port
connector for a personal computer. The pins on the microcontroller are brought out to connectors and often a breadboard area is provided so the engineer
can add additional circuits. The final solution is in-circuit emulation where the microcontroller in the actual target system is replaced with a connector to
the emulator which drives the actual hardware like the microcontroller but allows monitoring execution like a debugger program.</p>
<h2><a name="The 68HC12 Simulator"></a>The 68HCS12 Simulator</h2>

<p>A simulator is a computer program that models the behavior of an actual microcontroller. It simulates the CPU, memory, and peripheral interfaces. While
a simulator typically does not run as fast as the microcontroller (referred to as <em>real-time</em>), it keeps track of the simulation time so that accurate timing
measurements can be made. Of course, the simulator cannot be connected to any physical devices and run real-time. If connection to physical devices is
necessary, one of the other alternatives must be used.</p>

<p>An advantage of the simulator is that it is not real hardware. It is possible to stop time, making it easier to debug time-critical routines. Debugging with a
simulator can be more sophisticated than with real hardware since more of the system can be monitored.</p>

<p>The simulator supplied on the CD is configured to simulate the evaluation board described below. This makes it easy to develop and test software on the
simulator and then do final testing on the evaluation board in the lab. Besides the RAM and ROM, the simulator also models the analog to digital
converter, timers, and serial port. On a 400 MHz Pentium II processor, the simulation speed is roughly 1/8 to 1/10 real-time.</p>

<p>Documentation for the simulator is available when running the simulator
or from the <em>start</em> menu once the simulator is installed.</p>
<h2><a name="DRAGON12">Dragon12-Plus</a> Evaluation Board</h2>

<p>There are many manufacturers of circuit boards for evaluating and
   breadboarding microcontroller systems. Usually the microcontroller
   manufacturer designs and sells evaluation boards to promote their products, but
   there are third-party manufacturers who have boards with
   additional features or who offer lower prices. The board referred to in
   this text is the Dragon12-Plus
Board from Wytec. It has the following features:</p>

<div class="boxed"><ul>
   <li>MC9S12DG256 microcontroller</li>
  <li>D-Bug12 debugger/monitor program in Flash EEPROM.</li>
  <li>Two serial ports.</li>
  <li>2x16 character LCD display</li>
  <li>4 digit LED 7 segment display</li>
  <li>Speaker</li>
  <li>Pushbuttons and DIP switches for input.</li>
  <li>IR transmitter and receiver.</li>
  <li>BDM interfaces.</li>
  <li>Power Supply regulator.</li>
  <li>All controller pins brought out on headers.</li>
  <li>Breadboarding area.</li>
  <li>(and many other features)</li>
</ul></div>

<p>Programs and hardware interfaces can be developed on the evaluation board.
The evaluation board can be used for product delivery; however it is typically
too expensive except for very low volume, custom projects.</p>

<h2><a name="In-circuit Emulation"></a>In-circuit Emulation</h2>

<p>In-circuit Emulators allow debugging microcontroller programs in the target application system. In the traditional approach, the microcontroller is
removed from the circuit board and an adapter is plugged in its socket. The microcontroller (or a special version of the microcontroller) plugs into a
socket on the adapter. This allows monitoring the signals on the microcontroller's pins. However the adapter can intervene to examine the processor state
(register and memory contents) and probe the system. In-circuit emulation is a powerful tool, however it usually has a high purchase cost.</p>

<p>The Freescale BDM (<em>Background Debug Mode</em>) feature provides a low cost approach to In-circuit Emulation. Physically, it is a single wire interface to
the microcontroller from a BDM "pod" that connects to personal computer. The microcontroller is installed in the target system. The BDM interface
provides typical debugger features, yet allows the processor to run
at-speed in its target environment. The BDM is discussed in the text
section <a href="part023b.html#Background Debug Mode"><i>Other Serial
   Interfaces</i></a>. Details of the BDM hardware interface can be found
in section 14 of the <em><a href="../motorola/S12CPU15UG.pdf">HCS12 Core Users Guide</a></em>. The DRAGON12 board can be used as a BDM pod, providing a debugging interface like D-Bug12 for another 68HCS12, for instance a second DRAGON12. Instructions for this use are provided with the DRAGON12.</p>
