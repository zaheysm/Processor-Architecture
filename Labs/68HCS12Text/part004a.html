<p>It is virtually impossible to write a program that is error-free. One software
aid in program testing and <em>debugging</em> is a debugger, or monitor, program which allows stepping execution and viewing and altering memory. The Freescale 68HC12 comes with a debugger called D-Bug12. Another aid is in taking a different design approach, using an interactive interpreter &quot;environment&quot; in the target system. Two common interpreters are BASIC and Forth.</p>
<h2><a name="Freescale D-BUG12"></a>Freescale D-Bug12</h2>

<p>The D-Bug12 program requires one of the 68HC12 serial communication interfaces (serial ports) be connected to a terminal, typically a personal computer. In
addition, when used in the HCS12, the debugger occupies 48k bytes of address space in a ROM, and uses 1024 bytes of the internal RAM. In return, the D-Bug12 has the following major features:</p>

<div class="minor"><ul>
  <li>Ability to download programs assembled on the personal computer into the microcontroller's memory.</li>
  <li>Interactive commands to read and write CPU registers, RAM and EEPROM memory, and to assemble and disassemble (convert from machine code to
assembler statements) code.</li>
  <li>Interactive commands to start program execution, stop at selected locations (called <em>breakpoints</em>), and <em>trace</em> execution by listing each instruction executed
along with register contents.</li>
  <li>A <em>library</em> of functions that can be used in programs to
     save programming time, providing D-Bug12 is always installed in the system.</li>
</ul></div>

<h2><a name="Forth Language Interpreter"></a>Forth Language Interpreter</h2>

<p>An interpreter combines the functionality of a debugger with that of an
assembler or compiler. Programs can be written and tested on the target
microcontroller and delivered as an application by moving the program from
RAM to EEPROM or ROM.  A common interpretive language found in microcontrollers
is Forth. Forth's interpreter models a stack machine like the classic HP
scientific calculators or the PostScript page composition language. The
Forth commands can be issued directly from the keyboard, or compiled into
functions called <em>words</em>. An initial set of words cover primitive operations such as arithmetic, memory
accessing, and printing. The original program example could be done in Forth this way:</p>
<pre>VARIABLE p VARIABLE q VARIABLE r<em></em></pre>

<p>This defines three variables.</p>
<pre>p C@ q C@ + 1 - r C!</pre>

<p>This fetches the byte at <em>p</em>, fetches the byte at <em>q</em>, adds them together, subtracts 1, and stores the result in byte <em>r</em>. If we wanted to compile the code to run at any
time, we could execute this definition:</p>
<pre>: test p C@ q C@ + 1 - r C! ;</pre>

<p>and then execute <em>test</em> to perform the calculation. Being an interactive environment, we could store values in p and q, and then print the value in r after execution
(the period word prints the value on the top of the stack):</p>
<pre>12 p C!  21 q C!  test  r C@ .</pre>

<p>This will print the 32, being (12+21-1).</p>
